# On a Discontinuous Galerkin discretization for a degenerate diffusion equation

This repository contains the code from my Bachelor's Thesis written at the Institute for Numerical and Applied Mathematics at the University of GÃ¶ttingen. The thesis was supervised by [Prof. Dr. Christoph Lehrenfeld](https://cpde.math.uni-goettingen.de/en/members/CLehrenfeld/index.html).

It deals with a Discontinuous Galerkin discretization for an degenerate diffusion equation.

In this repository, two jupyter notebooks explaining the implemented discretization for a constant and a non-constant density. Note that the latter does not explain code already explained in the former. 

The code uses the finite element software [NGSolve](https://ngsolve.org), specifically version 6.2.2102-163-g1362a8d5f which requires at Python 3.8 or higher.
